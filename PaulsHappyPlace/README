Done:
1. Load images from urls
2. basic pipeline for extraction, image selection and filtering

TODO:
1. Test color similarity function
2. Improve "find dominant color" function
3. Select images to 'extract' images from
4. Speed up / parallelize / move to GPU? Currently sequential calls to pallete and extract are slow
5. Integration with and caching with S3

6. TODO: Finetune the color distance metric: currently massively outweighing the colors that are much further away
