To run (on windows):

```
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main program is 
```
from collage.py import process_collage_images

process_collage_images(image_urls, local=False)
```

Done:
1. Load images from urls
2. basic pipeline for extraction, image selection and filtering

TODO:
4. Speed up / parallelize / move to GPU? Currently sequential calls to pallete and extract are slow
5. Integration with and caching with S3
6. Ensure that the new URLs in collage get the correct urls


Stretch
8. Make image extractor add frayed edges
