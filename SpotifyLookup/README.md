top albums is not available on Spotify Web API, only top artists and top tracks
however you can get the albums of the top 5 tracks and use those


also, currently, I'm using a bunch of private auth tokens in a .env file thats not in the github, but once we have a website there's a way to make it so the user can click "Log In With Spotify" and get the tokens from there. 
Since right now its just a script I didn't implement that yet.
